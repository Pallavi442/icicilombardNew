          What is Two Wheeler Insurance?
        </h3>
        <p>Two-wheeler insurance is a type of motor vehicle insurance designed specifically for motorcycles, scooters, and other two-wheelers. It provides financial protection against potential risks such as accidents, theft, natural disasters, and third-party liabilities. In India, having at least a basic Third-Party Liability insurance policy is legally mandatory under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.</p>
